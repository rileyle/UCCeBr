co60.mac simulates a 60Co source placed between two 3"x4" CeBr3
detectors facing each other and placed 5 cm from the source. The
detector placement is done using a geometry file:
two_3x4s_at_5_cm.geo.

The sorting code co60_sim_sort.py sorts singles spectra, with and
without energy resolution folded in, a gamma-gamma coincidence
matrix, and the spectrum of gamma rays collected in coincidence with
the 1332 keV transition.
